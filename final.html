		<h1> This is my Final Project for CSC 106</h1>
		<p> 
			Here is my final project. My partner and I decided to create a Jeopardy game with Disney themed questions. <br>
			<strong> Instructions </strong> <br>
			Click the start button to enter the game. <br>
			Once in the game, you will see categories along the top and questions ranging from point values of 100 - 400. <br>
			Click on a tile to open the question. You can only open each tile once. <br>
			When you click on a tile, a new screen will open up that states the question dn four options. <br>
			Click the right option and it will award you with points and take you to a correct screen. <br>
			Click the wrong option and you will not recieve points and it wil take you to a wrong screen. <br>
			From the <em> correct </em> or <em> wrong </em> screen, click the continue button to return to game screen. <br>
			Once all tiles have been opened, the program will take you to an end screen that states you final score. <br>
			I hope you enjoy this program and hope it challenges you knowledge on Disney.
